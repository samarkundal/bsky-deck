### Plan to Release:

I think for this whole to work, first we need is a usable MVP. And the way to build usable MVP is this:

1. User should be able to add a new column, delete column and change order for a column, copy column
2. Column should be of these types:
   1. Feed Posts
   2. Search Posts
   3. Hashtag Posts
   4. Home Timeline
   5. Trending News
   6. My Likes
   7. My Notifications
   8. User Feeds - My Follows, My Followers
   9. User Feed - Recently Engaged with me
   10. User Feed - Recently Engaged with User

Then user will be able to login their account - add their username and password
User can add Multiple accounts, switch across multiple accounts
